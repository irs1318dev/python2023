The tutorial consists of a set of Jupyter notebooks. The first ten lessons are intended to be completed on Google Colab. New programmers don't need to install any software and they can start coding right away.

The lesson notebooks are in the *output* folder. The notebooks were generated from templates and files in the *content* folder, using a custom Python package that will eventually be made available on Github.
