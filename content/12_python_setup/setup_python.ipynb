    "## Command Line Interfaces\n",
    "A graphical user interfaces (GUI) is what you are using right now to read this notebook. GUIs are computer interfaces that allow users to control software using things like mouse cursors, touch screens, buttons, menus, and checkboxes. They are used on smartphones, in web browsers, and in consumer operating systems like Microsoft Windows and macOS. GUIs are great for common activities like accessing social media, playing games, and writing term papers. But when it comes to coding and data analysis, CLIs have several advantages. They are fast, flexible, and it's easy to automate processes that use CLIs. If you want to be a competent programmer or good at data analysis, then you need to know your way around CLIs.\n",

    "The terms *terminal* and *shell* occur frequently in documents about CLIs.\n",
    "* **Terminal**: A terminal is a program that allows a user to interact with a CLI. Operating systems with graphical user interfaces typically include one or more terminal programs. Windows provides the Command Prompt and Powershell terminals. Ubuntu and macOS both named their default terminal applications \"Terminal\". If you want to change your CLI's font size or background color, you do that by changing settings within the terminal.\n",
    "* **Shell**: A shell is the program that reads and interprets the commands that a user enters into a CLI and passes them to the operating system to be carried out. There is often more than one shell for a given operating system. Linux and macOS have several shells, including bash, csh, ksh, zsh, etc. Windows has the Command Shell and Powershell. Terminal programs can usually be configured to run different shells.\n",
    "* **CLI**: A CLI incoporates both a terminal and a shell.\n",

    "Jupyter is primarily used to run code in notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are very similar to the notebooks that you've already been using on Google Colab, so we won't spend much time reviewing them in this lesson. Instead, [watch the video on the Juypterlab overview page](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html). There are more helpful vides on on the [Notebook User Guide page](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html).
