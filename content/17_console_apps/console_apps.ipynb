Command line programs are sometimes called console applications.\n",

    "## Python Packaging\n",
    "In computer programming, the term *packaging* refers to organizing the code and configuration files for a computer program to make it easy to share with others. While we could share code by sharing a Github repo or distributing a zip archive with all of our Python files, these methods are not considered *packaging*, because they require the user to complete several manual installation and configuration steps to get the program to run. Assembling code into a package allows users to automatically install and configure the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main repositories of Python packages:\n",
    "1. [The Python Package Index at pypi.org](https://pypi.org/)\n",
    "2. [The Anaconda Repository at repo.anaconda.com/](https://repo.anaconda.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Package Index is the original package Python package repository. It is usually abbreviated as PyPi (pronounced Pie-Pee-Eye). Anyone can create an account on PyPi and upload their package. Once uploaded, the package can be installed by anyone by running `pip install <package-name>`. This notebook will show you how to package your program so it can be uploaded to PyPi.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Repository is maintained by *Anaconda Inc.*, which is a private for-profit company. Users must be using the Anaconda Python distribution to use Anaconda packages. Anaconda packages are installed with the `conda` command-line tool. There are some advantages to using Anaconda, but the learning curve for building Anaconda packages is steep so we will not cover building Anaconda packages in this notebook."
