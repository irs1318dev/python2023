    "# Managing Big Arrays with Numpy\n",
    "Numpy is a package that provides a special array datatype. Numpy arrays are compact, fast, and are often preferable to Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't misunderstand me - Python lists are a great tool. They can hold any datatype and are easily resize-able. You can also use the list comprehension syntax to make new lists. Analysts shouldn't hesitate to use lists for reasonably-sized datasets. Do you have hundreds of items? Thousands? Maybe even tens of thousands? A list is probably fine for these situations If your calculations are not too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you have millions of items in your data structure? Or more? You might be happier if you use a Numpy array for such large amounts of data. Here's why:\n",
    "* Operations with large datasets are faster with Numpy.\n",
    "* Pandas uses Numpy under the hood to store data, so a good understanding of Numpy will help you get more out of Pandas.\n",
    "* Numpy operations are *element-wise* operations, which allows you to accomplish more with less code. This notebook will explain what *element-wise* means.\n",
    "* Numpy is used in many Python programs, so understanding Numpy will help you understand other people's code.\n",
    "* Understanding Numpy will help you understand how your computer's memory works."

    "1. Use a list when you must store varying or complex data types. \n",
    "    * Numpy arrays work great for primitive data types like integers and floating point values.\n",

    "2. Use a list when the number of elements will increase over time.\n",
    "    * Python lists always reserve more memory than they need, just in case programmers want to make the list longer. Operations that increase the size of a list are efficient.\n",
    "    * Increasing the length of a Numpy array, on the other hand, is EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT! It's best to figure out how big your Numpy array needs to be before you create it, then intialize the Numpy array all at once. For example, if you need a 1000 x 1000 element 2D Numpy array, you can initialize it to contain all zeros and then change the elements later.\n",

    "Why did this work?\n",
    "* First, we used the [Numpy's sum method](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.sum.html#numpy.ndarray.sum) to calculate the sum of values for each row in the array. We used the `axis` parameter to tell Numpy to sum along the rows. If we had passed `axis=0`, Numpy would have calculated a sum for each column.\n",
    "* Next, we used [Numpy's argmax function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html#numpy-argmax) to get the index of the array item with the highest value.\n",
    "{% index:\n",
    "    - numpy.argmax: code %}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Axis Parameter\n",
    "Many Numpy methods and functions accept an `axis` parameter. The `axis` parameter specifies which array dimension should be operated on. It accepts an integer ranging from 0 to the number of array dimensions minus one. So operations on a 2D array will accept values of 0 or 1 for the axis parameter, 3D arrays will accept 0, 1, or 2, and so on.\n",
    "{% index: Numpy, axis parameter %}\n",
    "\n",
    "The `axis` parameter sometimes seems counter-intuitive. If dimension 0 corresponds to the array's rows, and dimension 1 corresponds to the array's columns, then it seems like we should pass 0 to the `axis` parameter to calculate a sum for each row, not 1. Here's the key: Pass the number of the dimension *whose length will be changed* to the `axis` parameter. When we calculate a sum for each row, the resulting array has length 5,000, or a value for each row. But the 784 columns have been collapsed to a single value, the sum. So the number of rows stayed the same, but the number of columns changed. So to get this behavior, we have to pass the dimension number for the columns, 1, to the `axis` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior makes more sense if you consider arrays of three or more dimensions. If we want to calculate sums along one dimension of a 3D array, we pass in the number of the single dimension that we want to sum. The alternative would be to pass in all the dimensions that *we don't want to sum*, which would be onerous.

    "Pick a five second period where the human-made radiation source was most visible. Use [Numpy's sum method](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html#numpy.sum) to sum the gamma ray counts for each energy bin for that five second period. Display a line chart of the summed spectra.\n",
