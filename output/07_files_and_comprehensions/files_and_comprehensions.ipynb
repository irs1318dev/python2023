As written, with just the file name, the `open()` function will expect the *hopper.txt* file to be located in the same folder as this notebook.

For example, if *hopper.txt* was in a subfolder called *text_files*, we would pass this value to `open()`: *`\"text_files/hopper.txt\"`*\n",
    "* **Relative Path to Parent Folder:** Adding two periods (*`..`*) to the path tells Python to go to up one folder. For example, if *hopper.txt* was located in the parent folder of this notebook, we would pass *`\"../hopper.txt\"`* to `open()`. If *hopper.txt* was two folders up, we would pass *`\"../../hopper.txt\"`*.\n",

For example, *`\"../brilliant_computer_scientists/hopper.txt\"`* will jump up to a parent folder and then down to a sibling folder called *brilliant_computer_scientists*.\n",
    "* **Absolute Paths:** An absolute path, starting with the root folder, can refer to any file on the computer. For example, *`\"C:/Users/tyson/projects/pyclass_frc/lessons/07_comprehensions_and_files/hopper.txt\"`* is an absolute path on a Windows computer.  On a linux system the path might look like *`\"/home/Users/tyson/projects/pyclass_frc/lessons/07_comprehensions_and_files/hopper.txt\"`* and on an apple computer it might look like *`\"/Users/tyson/projects/pyclass_frc/lessons/07_comprehensions_and_files/hopper.txt\"`*\n",

That's why, when you push files to a Github repository from Windows, you see all those messages about the end of line characters on the screen. Git is automatically converting your text files from using Windows style \"\\r\\n\" sequences to Linux style \"\\n\" sequences.

    "Linux doesn't use '\\r\\n' because Linux was designed to be compatible with an older operating system called Unix (Bell Labs, 1969), which itself was inspired by an even older operating system called MULTICS (Cooperattive project of MIT, Bel Labs, and General Electric, 1964). MULTICS used a device driver to communicate with the teletype (very innovative at the time). So text files could contain the simpler '\\n' line ending and the device driver would convert '\\n' to whatever sequence of characters the teletype needed to advance to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there you have it. Windows uses '\\r\\n' because the developers of CP/M  in 1974 didn't use a device driver to talk to teletype machines. This might have been due to CP/M being a single-tasking operating system designed to work on small computers with 8-bit processors and no more than 64 kilobytes of memory. I'm guessing there was not a lot of extra bandwidth to be running a device driver. MULTICS, on the other hand, was designed to run on more powerful mainframe computers, like the GE-600 series.\n",

    "**And Now Back to Modern Times**  \n",
    "Most of the tools used by our robotics team take care of newline sequences without much trouble, so there's no need to memorize all of the different end of line sequences. But differences between newline sequences have caused headaches for many people in the past and could do so again in the future, so it's important to understand that different operating systems use different sequences. For Python, just use '\\n'."
