    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "We covered basic plotting with the Matplotlib package in [lesson 10]numpy.ipynb. We used the Matplotlib package because it's the most commonly used plotting package for the Python language, it's similar to Matlab, it's used in many Internet code examples, and several other visualization packages are based on it (like Seaborn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we use a different plotting package for the scouting system. We want to provide the drive team, strategists, and lead scout with *interactive* visualizations that allow them to drill down into the data. Users should be able to select whatever teams, matches, or game aspects that interest them. The Bokeh plotting package is superior to Matplotlib in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Bokeh Gallary](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) has several examples of interactive plots. The [Ineractive Movie Explorer](https://demo.bokeh.org/movies) has data filtering features that could be useful in an FRC scouting system. The [Gapminder Visualization on Life Expectancy and Family Size](https://demo.bokeh.org/gapminder) shows how plot animation can show trends that would otherwise be difficult to understand.\n",

See [the Bokeh reference for the Figure object](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference/plotting/figure.html#id2) for a complete list.\n",

    "### H. Step 3: Tweaking the Plot\n",
    "Comment out the line for step 3 to see what it does. It formats the y axis to show home price in thousands of dollars. This is much easier to read than the scientific notation that was used by default. This is just one of the many ways that plot appearance can be customized.\n",

    "#### 1. Explanation\n",
    "1. The BokehJS JavaScript module (see III.A) contains functions that generate a plot from the large JSON string (see III.B).\n",
    "2. The JSON string contains all of the information needed to generate the plot, including the source data, axis labels, titles, and formatting. Much of the JSON is human readable. The long random alphanumeric strings following `\"__ndarray__\"` are textual encodings of binary arrays of floating point values.\n",
    "3. The final `<script>` element calls functions from the BokehJS module (see III.C) that convert the JSON data to a graphical plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Bokeh displays the plot using an [HTML5 `<canvas>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). Canvas elements allow web designers to draw lines and shapes in a webpage using JavaScript. Since the plot was drawn with JavaScript, it can be *modified* with JavaScript. This is where the interactivity comes from. When you use the plot's tools to pan or zoom, JavaScript is running within the webpage that updates the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh can also be configured to draw plots with [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG). SVG uses an XML-based markup language to draw graphic elements in a webpage. One big difference between SVG and canvas elements is that SVG graphics are vector-based and canvas graphics are raster-based. SVG will perform better in some situations and canvas elements will perform better in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh provides a third option for drawing plots called WebGL. WebGL enables browsers to use hardware acceleration to render complex graphic objects. For example, if we were to plot all 26,000 rows in our housing dataset, we could used WebGL to get better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh refers to svg, canvas, and webgl as *backends*. Unless we run into problems, we'll stick with the default canvas backend for the scouting system. Search Bokeh's documentation for the term *backend* to learn how to change Bokeh's default behavior."
