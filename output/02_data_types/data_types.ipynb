    "1. Don't establish a routine for learning Python. Make sure at least two weeks elapse between sessions, so you can forget all of the old material before attempting anything new.\n",
    "2. Assume comprehension is overrated - go ahead and speed-read the explanations and documentation.\n",
    "3. If the code works, don't ask yourself why it worked this time and didn't work last time. Just move on.\n",
    "4. Use copy and paste as much as you can. Don't practice the details of syntax by typing out code by hand.\n",
    "5. Minimize mental effort. Immediately look up the answer to an exercise if the solution is not obvious.\n",
    "6. Avoid reading official documentation like the plague.\n",
    "7. Don't ever look at anyone else's code to see how they approached a problem.\n",
    "8. Don't talk about concepts or exercises with other students or mentors. Assume you are on your own if you get stuck.\n",
    "9. Don't try anything that's not mentioned in this course. Assume your computer will burst into flames if you do.\n",

    "### B. Function Arguments and Return Values\n",
    "Remember how in lesson1 we used `print()` to make Python display things? Or how we used `round()` to round numbers to an integer? How about `len()` for finding out how many characters are in a string? `print()`, `round()`, and `len()`, are functions. We pass data to the function by placing literals or variables inside the parentheses that follow the function's name. The values that we pass to functions are called ***arguments***. \n",

Objects of these types consist of only a single number that cannot be broken down into smaller values (which is why they are sometimes called *atomic*).

Python strings are usually described as a sequence data type.\n",
