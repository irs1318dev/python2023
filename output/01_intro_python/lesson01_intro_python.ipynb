The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, is apparently a fan of *Monty Python's Flying Circus*, which was a British sketch comedy TV series that ran from 1969 to 1974. The name reflects one of the goals of Python's developers - Python should be fun to use. [Here is a link to the mentor's favorite Monty Python sketch](https://youtu.be/xpAvcGcEc0k).\n",
