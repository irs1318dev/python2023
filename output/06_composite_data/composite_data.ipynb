The `var1` variable contains an integer object and `var2` contains a float. Both variables are initially set to the value 999. When we added one to this `var1` and `var2`, instead of modifying the value for the original integer or float object, Python created brand new objects with values of 1000 and assigned `var1` and `var2` to reference these new objects.<a id=\"cid49\"></a>\n",
