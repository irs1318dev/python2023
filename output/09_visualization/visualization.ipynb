    "Data visualization refers presenting information by physically arranging textual and graphic elements. Charts, graphs, plots, tables, and maps are all examples of data visualization. Visualization is an integral part of analytics and data science because it allows people to more easily and efficiently interpret large amounts of data. It's an important skill that is used widely in the professional world. In FRC, we analyze team performance by graphing scouting data, which helps us evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of all robots at the competition!\n",

    "There are many styles of data visualizations, both static and interactive. Here are some fun examples on the web:\n",

    "Python has numerous packages for creating visualizations. We will start by creating visualizations with the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) package. That will be followed by a short review of the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) package. Finally, we'll explore the [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) package."
